Arachnida üï∑Ô∏è
Arachnida is a Python-based toolset for web scraping and metadata extraction, designed for efficient data retrieval and analysis. The project consists of two main utilities:

Spider: A web scraper to download images and documents recursively from websites.
Scorpion: A metadata analyzer to extract EXIF and other attributes from image files.
Features
Spider
Recursive Scraping: Crawl through websites to download supported files (e.g., images, PDFs, and DOCX).
Depth Control: Set the recursion depth for targeted scraping.
Custom Paths: Specify download directories for organized data storage.
Silent Mode: Suppress output for seamless operation.
Scorpion
Metadata Extraction: Extract EXIF and metadata from supported image formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, BMP).
Batch Processing: Analyze individual files or entire directories.
Detailed Attributes: View creation dates, camera details, and more.
